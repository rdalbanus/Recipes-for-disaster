# Pão com Lingűiça (Sausage Bread)
Preparation time (~20 min prep + 30-45 min cooking)

## Ingredients
* All-purpose flour
* Sausage (e.g. smoked kielbasa)
* Olive oil
* Salt
* Sugar
* Baker's yeast
* Water

## Directions
1. Start with 250 ml (8.5 oz) of water in a small container and add 1 cup of flour, 1 tablespoon of salt, 1.5 tablespoons of sugar, and 1/2 tablespoon of yeast. Mix until it becomes homogeneous.
2. One cup at a time, keep adding flour and mixing until the dough becomes solid enough to stand on its own when you pull the mixer out.
3. Transfer the dough to a clean surface with enough space for kneading. Keep kneading and adding flour until the dough is not sticking to your hands anymore.
4. Shape the dough into a small ball and leave it covered with a dishrag in a warm place (>25°C) for 1-2h. Check every 30 min to see if it's rising. It should rise to ~2x size.
5. Meanwhile, chop the sausage into small pieces (3-4 mm cubes). No neeed to pre-cook.
6. Knead the raised dough with the sausage bits into whatever final shape you want. I recommend a round shape to decrease the crust-to-bread ratio.
7. Cut the top of the dough with a knife (~1.5 cm deep) and add as much olive oil it can fit inside. There should be some empty spaces where the bread touches the sausage pieces.
8. Put the dough a pre-heated oven at 325°F (160°C) for ~30 min. Take it out once it's dark gold and starts smelling really good.
